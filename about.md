My story begins in Northern Minnesota on the shores of Lake Superior. I was raised for next 17 and a half years there. I the packed up and partially said goodbye to the cold and moved to Providence, Rhode Island to start college at Brown University. I am now entering my final semester and finishing my degrees in Ethnic Studies and Computer Science. My academic path has been anything but linear, taking 10 classes in my first year. But I finally found my passion in using computer science to further the humanities and politics.

Throughout my time at Brown, I also developed another passion: higher education administration. I have taken on numerous leadership positions and been involved on several councils. I served as Director of Communications and Co-Chair of Greek Council, working to bring two new organizations onto campus and work with our 14 organizations to develop a new mission statement. I rebuilt and chaired the Residential Council during a substantial turnover in staff in the Office of Residential Life. I further served on the Information Technology Advisory Board and the Undergraduate Library Advisory Board, providing feedback on the experiences of undergraduates.

I have volunteered with [Generation Citizen](https://generationcitizen.org) and STEMS ([Swearer](https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/swearer/) Teaching and Enrichment for Math and Sciences). In my first semester, I worked with an 8th-grade class at Slater Middle School in Pawtucket, RI. I taught twice weekly and gave students the tools to lead an anti-bullying campaign.

The summer before I started college I worked with other Progressive Duluthians to found Twin Ports for Change. I wrote the bylaws and prepared FEC fillings. The organization over the coming months would transform into Duluth branch of Our Revolution MN. Through that, I have read through the entirity of federal campaign finance law and regulations, as well as writing extensively on _Citizens United v. FEC_ and campaign finance regulation.
