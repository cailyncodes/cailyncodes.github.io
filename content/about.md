## About me

My name is Cailyn Hansen, and my pronouns are she/they. I am exploring what I can do to build a revolutionary and liberatory future through community building, collaborative writing, generative conflict, and collective creative imagining. In my lesiure, I read, bike, bird watch, bake, and play board games. I was formerly a senior engineering manager at Duolingo. Check out my projects below to learn more about any of these.

I have a nuanced relationship to labels and identity, especially around gender, sexuality, and intimacy. However, I could be described as a white, polyamorous, bisexual, genderfluid, trans woman. These identities and lived experiences thereof inform both my theory and praxis in the world.

At incredible risk given the current US government's administration, but I feel with incredible importance to be visible in these beliefs, I share that I am an abolitionist (of prisons, the criminal legal system, family, the state, pathology of mental health, and more). I'm also an anti-capitalist and communitarian anarchist. I don't reject participation in electoral politics, but I find it a much more effective use of my time to build relationships that further delivery on my vision of the future.
