## About

I'm a queer, genderfluid, trans woman who's based in NYC. I am focused on transformative justice, community building and mutual aid, and designing social infrastructure towards liberatory futures.

Recently, I left a career in software engineering where I was a senior engineering manager at Duolingo.

My hobbies include biking, watching birds, baking a lot of bread, and playing board games.

In terms of politics, I could perhaps be summarized as an abolitionist and communitarian anarchist.
