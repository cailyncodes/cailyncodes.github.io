## Borders and Othering: (De)Constructing Maps of North America

I graduated from Brown University in May 2019 with degress in ethnic studies and computer science. My capstone project/thesis explored the ways maps a) encode hidden dimensions of information and b) are politcal projects themselves. I created [Borders and Othering: (De)Constructing Maps of North America](https://www.bordersandothering.org/) to present under-told histories of U.S. westward expansion, nativist imperialism, and the impact on Mexico and indigenous communities. It does so by creating an interactive environment to explore the way maps are produced, display information, and leave certain narratives untold.
