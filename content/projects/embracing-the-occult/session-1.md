## Session 1 of Embracing the Occult; Rejecting the Rational

[Main page for "Embracing the Occult; Rejecting the Rational"](/projects/embracing-the-occult)

**Notes from** Wouter Hanegraaff, __Esotericism and the Academy__ (Introduction)
\- __Esotericism and the Academy__  is the history of the how esotericism is studied
\- Esotericism was expelled by Enlightment and Protestant ideas
\- Academics often warn against or avoid Western Esotericism
\- It is often seen as "the Other"
\- Academic thought is constructed as an implicit rejection of esotericism and the occult
\- How we think about esotericism and the occult is entwined (in rejection of) with how we think about ourselves
\- If our understanding of esotericism and the occult is wrong, then there is a question about whether what we think is true about us is wrong

**Notes from** Silvia Federici, __Caliban and the Witch__ (Introduction)
\- Text is a study of the genesis of capitalism through a feminist perspective
\- It locates both women and anti-colonial rebel as symbol of world proletariat and the body thereof as terrain of resistance to logic of capitalism
\- Witch is an embodiment of who capitalism had to kill (e.g. heretic, healer, disobedient wife, women who lived alone, enslaved women who poisioned those who enslaved them and planned revolt)
\- There has been a return of witch hunting (in e.g. Brazil)
\- Contemporary global capitalism is sustaining itself through criminalization and displacement of labor
\- Primitive accumulation, as outlined by Marx, is a historical process through which capitalist relations were premised
\- The serve as a foundational process that allows us to read the past as something that survives into the present
\- Marx saw primitive accumulation as oriented around the waged male proletariat
\- Federici sees it as the changes in women's social position and production of labor-power
\- Federic's privimite accumulation includes the following historical processes 
\-\- The development of a new sexual division of labor that subjugates woman's labor and reproduction to merely workforce creation
\-\- A new partiarchal order centered on the exclusion of women and their subordination to men
\-\- Mechaninization of the (female) body into machine for new workers
\-  **Central Claim:** Persecution of witches is as important as colonialization and expropriation of European peasantry of land in the development of capitalism (following feudalism)
\- Marx saw capitalism as stepping stone towards libration from scarcity and necessity
\- He assumed that violence (bringing forth capitalism) would wane as capitalism matured
\- Federici argues that violence, expropriation, plunder, and degregation are necessary at all times for the maintenance of capitalism
\- Federici claims that Marx would never have assumed that capitalism leads to liberation if he approached his analysis from a women's perspective
\- Women experience a particular exploitation
\- This gives rise to the necessity of analysis of capitalism from a women's perspective
