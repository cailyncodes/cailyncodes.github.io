## Embracing the Occult; Rejecting the Rational: An open inquiry into esotericism, ritual, and the politics of knowing

<img src="/assets/images/winter-solstice-syllabus.jpg" />

<p style="text-align: center;">__This is a gathering, not a class; a temporary autonomous space for unlearning mastery and studying hidden lineages in community.__</p>

### Description

"Embracing the Occult; Rejecting the Rational" provides participants with the foundation to understand core themes in esotericism while challenging common preconceived ideas around rationality and reason. The course begins with a primer on the study of esotericism and key themes around the Occult before exploring a range of Winter Solstice traditions. These traditions will be explored and analyzed through a critical lens while also providing students opportunities for practical application. It also covers the advent of Enlightenment and its disruption of esoteric beliefs. The course is also critical of the connection between fascism and the occult. Upon completion of this course, participants will be prepared to take further emic coursework in subjects such as witchery, tarot, alchemy, astrology, and magick; or etic classes like "History of Magick" and "Critical Epistemology: Exploring the 'How' to Knowing" which we encourage participants to make real.

### Course Content

This ten-week open gathering explores the hidden lineages of esoteric thought and their tension with Enlightenment rationality. We approach “the occult” not as superstition but as a set of world-making practices that resist mastery and restore relational ways of knowing. Each session blends reading, dialogue, and esoteric practice, culminating in a communal Winter Solstice ritual.
