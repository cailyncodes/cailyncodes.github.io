## Thavalon

[Thavalon](https://github.com/aquadrizzt/THavalon) (or Tech House Avalon) was a reskin of [The Resistence: Avalon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/the-resistance-avalon) by several friends of mine in college. 

I started with aquadrizzt's implementation that we used at school and readapted it for a modern web app. With that, I built [https://next.thavalon.quest/](https://next.thavalon.quest/) to assign roles and (partially) support in-app voting.

I had initially used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) with much success. When we went to add in-app voting, I decided to transition to [Railway](https://railway.com/), which is now my go-to IaaS provider.
