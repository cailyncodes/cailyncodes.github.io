## Reading List

A very much abridged list of things I have read, occasionally with some of my thoughts.

\- __Dawn__ by Octavia Butler
My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE book of all time.

\- __Parable of the Sower__ by Octavia Butler
My second favorite book. Highly recommend reading it alongside __Emergent Strategy__ by Adrienne Marie Brown.

\- __Emergent Strategy__ by Adrienne Marie Brown
See above :)

\- __Babel, or the Necessity of Violence__ by R. F. Kuang
One of my favorites, especially for its plot (and message, even though it hits you on the head with it). The characters were compelling if a little bit flat. Overall, hard to put down.

\- __The Impossible Community: Realizing Communatarian Anarchism__ by John P. Clark
