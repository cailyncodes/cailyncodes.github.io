                Even under the amber streetlight, it is difficult to see our shadows. Is tonight an especially dark
                night
                or the streetlight particularly dim? The blue glow of the moon is obscured by brooding clouds overhead.
                I
                no longer recall where we are precisely – perhaps Transit Street. In any case, it is somewhere on the
                east
                side of Providence. The frigid air caresses my cheeks, and I feel the sting piercing my nostrils and
                lungs
                with every breath. Well, at least at the beginning I did. We are still several blocks away. We aren’t
                in a
                rush, though. The small rabbit scurrying by distracts us. Hop. Hop. “Where is the house?” “On
                Governor.”
                “Oh, okay.” I forgot my glasses, so street signs mean nothing to me. Eight of us are on our way. His
                house-warming party. Everyone is invited.<br />
                <br />
                The feeling in my face is immediately returned by a wave of unbearable heat. Sweat from the bodies
                mixes
                with a puddle on the floor. Vodka, I assume. Did someone turn the heat on? A broken lamp twitches in
                the
                corner. No one pays it any attention. A stolen flood light provides the only meaningful illumination;
                it
                blinds me as I turn towards it. I keep my focus on the other side of the room. Cracked Solo cups are
                scattered about. I brush a few into a pile with my feet. A hand waves at me. I maneuver through the
                indistinguishable blob of bodies. I don’t say excuse me; no one could hear me anyways. The music, what
                song
                is this? The bass overpowers the lyrics, although I’m not sure it has any. Thump, thump. Thump, thump.
                The
                stale scent of alcohol strikes me as my slow progress is further impeded by a sea of elbows.<br />
                “Hey, Cailyn!”<br />
                Who said that?<br />
                “How’s it going?”<br />
                It’s him.<br />
                “You look gorgeous. When did you get here?”<br />
                I can’t hear. What did he say?<br />
                “It’s kinda loud. Let’s go upstairs.”<br />
                I feel my feet moving and my mouth saying okay, even though I want neither. Step. Step.<br />
                “Oh, be careful. It’s steep.”<br />
                Step. Step. The bedroom door is open. Inside. The noise from downstairs is muffled and difficult to
                hear.
                He gestures for me to sit. A chill runs down my spine, but it might just be the draft from the window.
                The
                door is closing. Closed.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Nothing happened. I can’t – not that I want to – say that anything even came close to happening. This
                time.
                But it transports me: A different guy. A basement. At a party. On an unfamiliar campus. A compliment. A
                kiss. An invitation. A no that somehow contorted itself into a yes by the time it reached his ears. <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                They come upstairs. “Cailyn, where are you? We are heading back. What’s going on?” “Nothing”, we both
                say,
                although his answer doesn’t reassure me. We were just talking about our classes. He and I say goodbye.
                Nothing happened.<br />
                <br />
                We shuffle our way through the musty heat of the foyer. Back outside we go. On Waterman – or maybe
                Angel –
                a sprinkler throws water into the sky. I run to it. It covers me with water. Back and forth. Laughter.
                I am
                soaking. I don’t worry. We make it back. The swing! Let’s swing. We swing. It creaks; we move. Faster.
                Louder; it creeks. Faster. Faster. Louder. Water beads down. It is not from the sprinkler. My face.
                Tears.
                Louder. Faster. Tears blur into the water. Shaking. Faster. Louder. Curl up. Knees to chest. Faster.
                Shake. Faster. Louder. Faster. I need to go inside. I stumble. I am crying. Squeeze. What am I
                squeezing? Cry. Louder. Faster. What? A staircase. The railing. “Are you okay?” Am I okay? Am I?
                Faster.
                Cry. Louder. Squeeze. Harder. Cry. “Isa. Can you get Isa?” She comes. Cry. Release. Upstairs. To my
                room.
                “Bill, can you give us a minute?” Bill sleeps in the lounge.<br />
                <br />
                I need to find it. “What?” I don’t answer. “Cailyn, what are you looking for?” I rip open drawers and
                rummage. Not there. I pull apart folders, tear open notebooks. Still lost. I toss everything on my desk
                to
                the floor. It’s not here. I need it. “What?” Isa pleads as her voice quivers. “Cailyn, what do you
                need?”
                My closet. I yank out storage boxes. Dump them on the ground. Isa maintains her composure – tears
                restrained – but pained by her friend’s state. I can’t find it.<br />
                <br />
                “Please. Cailyn. Breathe. Take a deep breath.” Breathe. “What are you looking for?” I breathe. Inhale.
                Exhale. Inhale. A poem. That night. I wrote a poem. I wanted solace, comfort. I wrote a poem: my past understanding of what happened, a reassurance of something that I could not make
                sense
                of. Safety for now provided by the reclaimed power of then. I never did find the poem.<br />
                <br />
                I slump against the wall, sobbing and weak. “It’s okay. It’s going to be okay. You are safe. I am
                here.”
                Breathe. We lie on my bed. The florescent light traps everything in its soft hum. I am held; I am
                secure.
                The tears fall more slowly. Cry. Shorter. Softer. I take a deep breath. Breathe. Softer. My eyes droop;
                my
                thoughts float away. Softer. Shorter. Isa holds me. Comfort. Safety. Breathe. Inhale. Exhale. Sleep. I
                drift asleep. Breathe.<br />
                <br />
