I wrote this paper for a class taught by [Ralph Rodriguez](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/rrodrigu){:target="_blank"} titled <em>Latinx Cultural Theory</em>. The paper seeks to understand how Americo Paredes and Abraham Cahan conceptualize questions surrounding immigrant success and assimilation. It offers a close reading on the final chapters of these novels and challenges predominant scholarship in the field about these novels, drawing on additional multicultural literary theory. The PDF is available for download: [The Question(s) of Success](/writings/academic/The%20Question(s)%20of%20Success.pdf).
